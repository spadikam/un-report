This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r data}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("../data/gapminder_1997.csv")

```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997}

  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent) + geom_point() + labs(x =
                                                                             "GDP per capita", y = "Life Expectancy")
